title: SVM on Breast Cancer Dataset.

## Installation

Pureml SDK & CLI can be directly installed using pip.

```bash
pip install pureml
```

## For additional project requirements we will need to install the following packages

You can use the following command to install the packages.

```bash
pip install  scikit-learn==1.2.2
 
```

OR

you can create a `requirements.txt` file with the following contents

```properties
scikit-learn==1.2.2
```

and run the following command

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

##  load your dataset

Start by creating a function to load the dataset into a DataFrame. We will use the @load_data() decorator from PureML SDK.

```python
from sklearn.datasets import load_breast_cancer
from pureml.decorators import load_data,dataset,model
import pureml
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split

@load_data()
def load_dataset():
    cancer_data = load_breast_cancer()
    return cancer_data
    
load_dataset()
```
<Note>
	{" "}If you need functions to pre-process the data then we can use prueml.decorators.transformer() function{" "}
</Note> 

## Creating a dataset

We can now create a dataset from the pipeline. The dataset will be created by executing the pipeline and saving the output of the last transformer in the pipeline. The dataset can be created by using the `@dataset` decorator. The decorator takes the following arguments:

- `label`: The name of the dataset
- `upload`: If `True`, the dataset will be uploaded to the cloud. If `False`, the dataset will be saved locally.

```python
@dataset(label='cancerdataset:development',upload=True)
def create_dataset():
    cancer_data = load_data()
    x = cancer_data.data
    y = cancer_data.target
    x_train,x_test,y_train,y_test = train_test_split(x,y,random_state=41)
    return {'x_train':x_train,'x_test':x_test,'y_train':y_train,'y_test':y_test}

create_dataset()
```
To fetch the dataset we can `pureml.dataset.fetch()` 

```python
df = pureml.dataset.fetch(label='cancerdataset:development:v1')
x_train = df['x_train']
x_test = df['x_test']
y_train = df['y_train']
y_test = df['y_test']
```

## Creating a model to classify the dataset

With the PureML model module, you can perform a variety of actions related to creating and managing models and branches.
PureML assists you with training and tracking all of your machine learning project information, including ML models and datasets, using semantic versioning and full artifact logging.

We can make a separate python file for the model. The model file will contain the model definition and the training code.
Let's start by adding the required imports.

```python
from sklearn.svm import SVC
```

The model training function can be created by using the `@model` decorator. The decorator takes the model name and branch as the argument in the format `model_name:branch_name`.


```python
df = pureml.dataset.fetch(label='cancerdataset:development:v1')
@model(label='cancer_svm:development')
def create_model():
    clf = SVC()
    clf.fit(x_train,y_train)
    y_pred = clf.predict(df['x_test'])
    accuracy = clf.score(x_test,y_test)
    print(f"The accuracy score: {accuracy}")
    pureml.log(metrics={'accuracy':accuracy})
    return clf

create_model()
```
<Note>
	{" "}
	The `pureml.log` function is used here to log the metrics and parameters of the
	model.{" "}
</Note>

To Fetch the Model we can use `pureml.model.fetch()`

```python
import pureml
pureml.model.fetch(label='cancer_svm:development:v2')
```

Once our training is complete our model will be ready to rock and rollðŸŽ¸âœ¨. But that's too much of a hassle. So for now, let's just do some predictions

## Let's Now create a `predict.py` file to store  prediction logic
```python
from pureml import BasePredictor, Input, Output
import pureml


class Predictor(BasePredictor):
    label = 'cancer_svm:development:v2'
    input = Input(type="numpy ndarray")
    output = Output(type="numpy ndarray")

    def load_models(self):
        self.model = pureml.model.fetch(self.label)

    def predict(self, data):
        predictions = self.model.predict(data)
        return predictions
```
 
## Add prediction to your model

For registered models, prediction function along with its requirements and resources can be logged to be used for further processes like evaluating and packaging.

PureML predict module has a method add. Here we are using the following arguments:

- `label`: The name of the model (model_name:branch_name:version)
- `paths`: The path to the predict.py file and requirements.txt file.

Our predict.py file has the script to load the model and make predictions. The requirements.txt file has the dependencies required to run the predict.py file.

<Note>
	{" "}
	You can know more about the prediction process [here](../prediction/versioning){" "}
</Note>

```python
import pureml

pureml.predict.add(label='cancer_svm:development:v2',paths={'predict': 'predict.py'})
```

## Create your first Evaluation

PureML has an eval method that runs a _task_type_ on a _label_model_ using a _label_dataset_.

```python
import pureml
pureml.eval(task_type='classification',
            label_model='cancer_svm:development:v2',
            label_dataset='cancerdataset:development:v1')
```
