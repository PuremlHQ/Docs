To get started with PureML, you'll need to install the PureML Python SDK. This SDK will allow you to work with the PureML platform, from creating your account to deploying your models.

To install PureML, simply run the following command:

<CodeGroup>

```bash >_ Terminal
pip3 install pureml
```

</CodeGroup>

If you`re a large company looking for a proof-of-concept, or an engineer looking to use the open-source version in a funky non-production way, then you're in the right place! Our Docker compose deployment let's you spin up a fresh Pureml instance in minutes.

Want more reliability? The easiest way to get started with PureML is to use [PureML Cloud](https://pureml.com/).

## Requirements

- A subsystem with docker-engine installed. [Installation guidelines](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/)

## Setting up the compose

1. In a new directory where you want to setup the containers, create a new file `docker-compose.yml`
2. Add the following content from our [official docker-compose example file](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/PuremlHQ/PureML/main/packages/pureml_docker/docker-compose.yml)

   ```yml docker-compose.yml
   version: "3"

   services:
     backend:
       image: puremlhq/pureml_backend:local-base
       environment:
         - PURE_SITE_BASE_URL=http://localhost:3000
       ports:
         - 8080:8080
       volumes:
         - pureml-data:/pureml_backend/data

     frontend:
       image: puremlhq/pureml_frontend
       environment:
         - BACKEND_URL=http://backend:8080/api/
       ports:
         - 3000:3000
       links:
         - backend

   volumes:
     pureml-data:
   ```

3. Run the following command to start your containers

   <CodeGroup>

   ```bash >_ Terminal
   docker compose up
   ```

    </CodeGroup>

> Make sure your docker engine is running for the docker command to work.

<Info>
  Additionally, to run the containers in background you can use the command
  `docker compose up -d` or `docker compose up --detach`
</Info>

If all goes well, you should have a PureML local instance setup and running

- PureML UI at [localhost:3000](https://localhost:3000) with your
- PureML Backend hosted at [localhost:8080/api](http://localhost:8080/api).

You can even checkout the auto generated Open API swagger documentation at [/api/swagger/index.html](http://localhost:8080/api/swagger/index.html)

## Update docker image

Make sure you are using latest docker image to use latest features of PureML. You can upgrade the package by using below command:

<CodeGroup>

```bash >_ Terminal
docker compose up --build
```

</CodeGroup>
