PureML Datasets are a crucial component for organizing user datasets. A Dataset serves as an empty container for storing the elements of the datasets and contains lineage, dataset-related graphs, and dataset files.

There are two types of datasets in PureML: Private Datasets, which only the user can access and view the content, and Public Datasets, which are accessible to all PureML users.

To register dataset files and add their relevant content to the Dataset, the user needs to initialize an empty Dataset, which can be done via the PureML Python package.

### Creating a Dataset

With the PureML dataset module, you can perform a variety of actions related to creating and managing datasets. Here's an overview of the available methods:

Creating a Dataset To create a new model, import the pureml module and use the `model.init` method:

```python
import pureml

pureml.dataset.init(label='FirstDataset', readme='ReadME.md')
```

The name of the dataset to be created are required parameters. You can also provide an optional readme file path.

<Note>
**label** parameter consists dataset name in the following format:

`_\<name>:\<name>:\<version>_`

For initializing a dataset, _version_ is not required. So, we use _\<name>_ as the label.

</Note>

<Warning>
  **label** should not contain any spaces. Special characters other than "**-**"
  and "**\_**" are not allowed
</Warning>

### Listing Datasets

To list all available datasets, use the `dataset.list` method:

```python
import pureml

pureml.dataset.list()
```

These methods make it easy to create and manage the models in PureML. By using them, you can streamline your model management workflows and improve collaboration among team members.
