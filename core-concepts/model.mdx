The PureML model registry provides a centralized location for users to store their models and manage their lifecycle collaboratively. This makes it easier for stakeholders to manage models and promotes transparency in accessing models for tests, deployment, audit, and other purposes.

With PureML, you can manage your models in the following ways:

- Create models to track and assess their relevance using generic model data.
- Automatically version models to efficiently organize model runs. PureML logs model parameters, metrics, and other metadata that changes for each registered model.
- Fetch stored models and their metadata through our API.

By using the PureML model registry, you can streamline your model management processes and facilitate collaboration among your team members. This allows for greater efficiency, transparency, and accuracy in managing your models.

### Creating Models

With the PureML model module, you can perform a variety of actions related to creating and managing models. Here's an overview of the available methods:

Creating a Model To create a new model, import the pureml module and use the `model.init` method:

```python
import pureml

pureml.model.init(label='FirstModel', readme='ReadME.md')
```

The name of the model to be created are required parameters. You can also provide an optional readme file path.

<Note>
  **label** parameter consists of model name in the following format:

`_\<name>:\<version>_`

For initializing a model, _version_ is not required. So, we use _\<name>:_ as the label.

</Note>

<Warning>
  **label** should not contain any spaces. Special characters other than "**-**"
  and "**\_**" are not allowed.
</Warning>

### Listing Models

To list all available models, use the `model.list` method:

```python
import pureml

pureml.model.list()
```

These methods make it easy to create and manage the models in PureML. By using them, you can streamline your model management workflows and improve collaboration among team members.
