| Average Confidence                           | Model Performance | This test checks the average confidence of the model predictions between the reference and evaluation sets to see if the metric has experienced significant degradation. The “confidence” of a prediction for classification tasks is defined as the distance between the probability of the predicted class (defined as the argmax over the prediction vector) and 1. We average this metric across all predictions.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             | During production, factors like distribution shift or a change in kk may cause model performance to decrease significantly. Since oftentimes labels are not available in a production setting, this metric can serve as a useful proxy for model performance.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       | By default, this test runs if predictions are specified (no labels required).                                                                                                                             |
| Average Thresholded Confidence               | Model Performance | This test checks the average thresholded confidence (ATC) of the model predictions between the reference and evaluation sets to see if the metric has experienced significant degradation. ATC is a method for estimating accuracy of unlabeled examples taken from [https://arxiv.org/abs/2201.04234](https://arxiv.org/abs/2201.04234) this paper. The threshold is first computed on the reference set: we pick a confidence threshold such that the percentage of datapoints whose max predicted probability is less than the threshold is around equal to the error rate of the model (here, it is 1-accuracy) on the reference set. Then, we apply this threshold in the evaluation set: the predicted accuracy is then equal to the percentage of datapoints with max predicted probability greater than this threshold.                                                                                   | During production, factors like distribution shift may cause model performance to decrease significantly. Since oftentimes labels are not available in a production setting, this metric can serve as a useful proxy for model performance.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         | By default, this test runs if predictions/labels are specified in the reference set and predictions are specified in the eval set (no labels required).                                                   |
| Calibration Comparison                       | Model Performance | This test checks that the reference and evaluation sets have sufficiently similar calibration curves as measured by the Mean Squared Error (MSE) between the two curves. The calibration curve is a line plot where the x-axis represents the average predicted probability and the y-axis is the proportion of positive predictions. The curve of the ideal calibrated model is thus a linear straight line from (0, 0) moving linearly.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         | Knowing how well-calibrated your model is can help you better interpret and act upon model outputs, and can even be an indicator of generalization. A greater difference between reference and evaluation curves could indicate a lack of generalizability. In addition, a change in calibration could indicate that decision-making or thresholding conducted upstream needs to change as it is behaving differently on held-out data.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             | By default, this test runs over the predictions and labels.                                                                                                                                               |
| Precision                                    | Model Performance | This test checks the Precision metric to see both if its performance on the evaluation set alone is satisfactory, as well as if performance in terms of Precision has degraded from the reference to evaluation set. The key detail displays whether the given performance metric has degraded beyond a defined threshold.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        | During production, factors like distribution shift or a change in kk may cause model performance to decrease significantly.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         | By default, this test runs over the Precision metric with the below thresholds set for the absolute and degradation tests.                                                                                |

This means that they are susceptible to generate sequences of words that are highly correlated, semantically similar, and sound coherent together, but that may not be factually consistent, a phenomenon commonly referred to as “hallucination”. It is important in general that your model outputs factually correct information, and especially that it is consistent with the specific information relevant to your specific application.                                                                                                                                                                                                       | By default, this test runs over all inputs in the evaluation dataset.                                                                                                                                     |
| Protected Feature Drift                      | Bias and Fairness | This test measures the change in the distribution of a feature by comparing the distribution in an evaluation set to a reference set.

| Demographic Parity (Pos Pred)                | Bias and Fairness | This test checks whether the Selection Rate for any subset of a feature performs as well as the best Selection Rate across all subsets of that feature. The Demographic Parity is calculated as the Positive Prediction Rate. The test first splits the dataset into various subsets depending on the quantiles of a given feature column. If the feature is categorical, the data is split based on the feature values. We then test whether the Selection Rate of model predictions within a specific subset is significantly lower than that of other subsets by taking a ratio of the rates. Also included in this test is the Impact Ratios tab, which includes a calculation of Disparate Impact Ratio for each subset.

It is meant to be used in a setting where we assert that the base Selection Rates between subgroups should be the same (even if empirically they are different). This contrasts with equality of opportunity or predictive parity tests, which permit classification rates to depend on a sensitive attribute. Comparing Positive Prediction Rates and Impact Ratios over all subsets can be useful in legal/compliance settings where we want the Selection Rate for any sensitive group to fundamentally be the same as other groups.                                                                                                                                                               | By default, the Selection Rate is computed for all protected features.

It runs over categorical protected features and uses the chi square test of independence to determine the feature independence. The test compares the observed data to a model that distributes the data according to the expectation that the variables are independent. Wherever the observed data does not fit the model, the likelihood that the variables are dependent becomes stronger.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        | A test of independence assesses whether observations consisting of measures on two variables, expressed in a contingency table, are independent of each other. This can be useful when assessing how protected features impact the predicted class and helping with the feature selection process.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  | By default, this test is run over all protected categorical features.                                                                                                                                     |
| Predict Protected Features                   | Bias and Fairness | The Predict Protected Features test works by training a multi-class logistic regression model to infer categorical protected features from unprotected categorical and numerical features. The model is fit to the reference data and scored based on its accuracy over the evaluation data. The unprotected categorical features are one-hot encoded.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            | In a compliance setting, it may be prohibited to include certain protected features in your training data. However, unprotected features might still provide your model with information about the protected features. If a simple logistic regression model can be trained to accurately predict protected features, your model might have a hidden reliance on protected features, resulting in biased decisions.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 | By default, the selection rate is computed for all protected features.                                                                                                                                    |
| Equal Opportunity (Recall)                   | Bias and Fairness | The recall test is more popularly referred to as equal opportunity or false negative error rate balance in fairness literature. This test checks whether the model performs equally well across a given subset of rows as it does across the whole dataset. The key detail displays the performance difference between the lowest performing subset and the overall population. The test first splits the dataset into various subsets depending on the quantiles of a given feature column. If the feature is categorical, the data is split based on the feature values. We then test whether the Recall of model predictions within a specific subset is significantly lower than the model prediction Recall over the entire population.                                                                                                                                                                      | Having different Recall between different subgroups is an important indicator of performance bias; in general, bias is an important phenomenon in machine learning and not only contains implications for and ethics, but also indicates failures in adequate feature representation and fairness spurious correlation. Unlike demographic parity, this test permits assuming different base label rates but flags differing mistake rates between different subgroups. An intuitive example is when the label indicates a positive attribute: if predicting whether to interview a given candidate, make sure that out of qualified candidates, the rate at which the model predicts a rejection is similar to group A and B.                                                      | By default, Recall is computed over all predictions/labels.

| Equal Opportunity (Macro Recall)             | Bias and Fairness | The recall test is more popularly referred to as equal opportunity or false negative error rate balance in fairness literature. When transitioning to the multiclass setting we can use macro recall which computes the recall of each individual class and then averages these numbers. This test checks whether the model performs equally well across a given subset of rows as it does across the whole dataset.

| Intersectional Group Fairness (Pos Pred)     | Bias and Fairness | This test checks whether the model performs equally well across subgroups created from the intersection of protected groups.
