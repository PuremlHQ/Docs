Created a model? No? [Create one now](/core-concepts/model#creating-models-and-branches). Yes? Here's what you should do next.

## Register Models

PureML assists you with creating, training, and tracking all of your machine learning project information, including ML models and datasets, using semantic versioning and full artifact logging.

This short tutorial will show you how to register and track machine learning models using PureML.

```bash
pip install pureml
pip install xgboost
```

```python
from sklearn.datasets import load_iris
from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
import xgboost as xgb
import pandas as pd
import pureml
from pureml.decorators.model import model
```

## Train and Register your Model Version

We will train a `XGBClassifier` to predict the classes of samples from `Iris dataset` in this tutorial. This is a straightforward training function that returns the trained model and prints the `accuracy` of our model. We will utilize the `Iris` data from sklearn.

```python
X, y = load_iris(return_X_y=True)
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, random_state=0)
```

```python
def train():
  xgb_model = xgb.XGBClassifier()
  xgb_model.fit(X_train, y_train)
  predictions = xgb_model.predict(X_test)

  acc = accuracy(y_test, predictions)
  print("accuracy: ", acc)

  return xgb_model

xgb_model = train()
```

## Now let's register our model to pureml

To register the model, add the `@model` decorator to the training function. PureML will register the returned trained model to your PureML project.

Let's also replace `print()` with `pureml.log()` to register obtained model metrics to the project.

```python
@model('iris_classifier:dev')
def train():
    xgb_model = xgb.XGBClassifier()
    xgb_model.fit(X_train, y_train)
    predictions = xgb_model.predict(X_test)

    acc = accuracy(y_test, predictions)

    pureml.log(metrics={'accuracy':acc})
    print("accuracy: ", acc)

    return xgb_model

xgb_model = train()
```

## Fetching a Model

Once you register your model to PureML, you can load the model from PureML using `model` module.

Let's look at how to load and generate predictions with your model:

```python
import pureml

model = pureml.model.fetch('iris_clasifier:dev')
X, y = load_iris(return_X_y=True)
preds = model.predict(X)
```

By default, `fetch` method fetches `latest` version of the model. A particular `version` of a model can be fetched by providing version parameter as the following.

```python
model = pureml.model.fetch('iris_classifier:dev:v3')
```

Here, we have fetched the version `v3` of the model `iris_classifier`.

```python
print('Prediction: ', preds[0])
```
