## New to SuperAlign?

If you're new to SuperAlign, you'll need to sign up for an account before you can start using the platform. CLI supports you to signup. You can do this using the `pureml` command line utility:

```bash >_ Terminal
pureml auth signup
```

</CodeGroup>

This command will prompt you to enter your email, user handle, name, and password to create your SuperAlign account. Once you register your details successfully, you will receive a verification mail on registered email Id to verify and proceed for login.
